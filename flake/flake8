#
# flake8 uses pycodestyle underneath (pycodestyle used to be called pep8)
#
# Showing violations in red
# =============================================================================================
#    Please see http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes for E*, W* definitions.
#    As you are editing .py with emacs in 'Python Elpy' mode,
#    flake8 shows pep8 python style violations as you save C-x,C-s.
#
#    ~/setup/bin/shared.sh copies these files:
#    %> /bin/cp ~/emacs/flake/flake* ~/.config/flake8
#
#    %> type flake8
#    flake8 is /usr/local/bin/flake8
#
#    flake8 looks at ~/.config/flake8 for config by default.
#
#    Also look at this:
#        http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
#    specifically:
#        http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html
#
#    flake8 handy debugging note:
#        When I had problems with flake8 and this configuration file (./flake8),
#        I googled and found https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/issues/1131.
#        I then loaded /tmp/test/hx.py (run ~/bin/test-emacs) and did C-c C-v
#        and the flake8 problem with the configuration file was then clear to me.
#
# Auto correcting pep8 violations
# =============================================================================================
#    Adding:
#        (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-autopep8-enable-on-save)
#    to .emacs, will correct most, if not all, pep8 violations upon 'save'.
#    ASIDE: elpy-format-code did not work for me, so, used py-autopep8 instead.

# E129:
# As far as I can tell from reading these:
#   https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8/issues/248
#   https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/126
#   https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/386
# E125 logical indent is something most people consider a bug, but it cannot be undone.
# E129 was introduced so it one can ignore all or some of E125.
#
# E265:
# E265 says block comment should start with '# ' (good: '# foo', bad: '#foo')
# .py code at new job is full of '#foo'.  I also find myself commenting things out
# temporarily and I do not want add the extra space.
#
# E501:
# Line too long.  I no longer ignore this.  autopep8 does a good job fixing about half of them.
# I manually fix others. Some long lines cannot be fixed (it's a really long line, like a certificate).
# For long lines that cannot be fixed, I add '  # noqa' to end to keep flake8 from complaining.
#
# max-line-length
#   - does nothing if ignore = E501 (which is not the case here)
#   - defaults to 79 chars (.py at new job uses 120, which happens to my preferred setting)
#
ignore = E129,E265
max-line-length = 120

# 'F821 undefined name' is a useful error.  Do NOT ignore F821.
# However, the .py code at new job has a lot of symbols that are injected by a test runner, 'runtests'.
# runtests prints this in log when run:
#     Identifiers to be automatically injected into your namespace:
#         ['_logger', 'api', 'devices', 'env_param', 'logger', 'runtests_logger', 'this_testsuite', 'topogen']
# Keep flake from flagging the following identifiers as 'F821 undefined name'.
#
builtins = _logger,api,devices,env_param,logger,runtests_logger,this_testsuite,topogen
