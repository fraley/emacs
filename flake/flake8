# As you are editing .py with emacs in 'Python Elpy' mode,
# flake8 shows pep8 python style violations as you save C-x,C-s.
#
# If (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-autopep8-enable-on-save)
# in .emacs, however, these violations will be corrected immediately.
# elpy-format-code does not do the right thing, btw.

# Look at this:
# http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
# specifically:
# http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html
#
# Also note:
# When I had had problems with flake8 and this configuration file,
# I googled and found https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/issues/1131.
# I then loaded /tmp/test/hx.py (run ~/bin/test-emacs) and did C-c C-v
# and the flake8 problem with the configuration file was then clear to me.
